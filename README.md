## Getting Started

### Dependencies

*__Note:__ if you've previously installed Gulp globally, run `npm rm --global gulp` to remove it. [Details here.](https://medium.com/gulpjs/gulp-sips-command-line-interface-e53411d4467)*

Make sure these are installed first.

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
- [Gulp Command Line Utility](http://gulpjs.com) `npm install --global gulp-cli`

### Quick Start

1. In bash/terminal/command line, `cd` into your project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install required files and dependencies.
3. When it's done installing, run one of the task runners to get going:
	- `gulp` manually compiles files.
	- `gulp watch` automatically compiles files and applies changes using [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io/) when you make changes to your source files.

**Try it out.** After installing, run `gulp` to compile some test files into the `dist` directory. Or, run `gulp watch` and make some changes to see them recompile automatically.



## Documentation

Add your source files to the appropriate `src` subdirectories. Gulp will process and and compile them into `dist`.

- JavaScript files in the `src/js` directory will be compiled to `dist/js`. Files in subdirectories under the `js` folder will be concatenated. For example, files in `js/detects` will compile into `detects.js`.
- Files in the `dist/sass` directory will be compiled to `src/css`.
- SVG files placed in the `src/svg` directory will be optimized with SVGO and compiled into `dist/svg`.
- Files and folders placed in the `copy` directory will be copied as-in into the `dist` directory.
